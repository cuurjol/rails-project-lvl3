# Application Bulletin Board

Bulletin Board is an application-clone of the famous service [Avito](https://www.avito.ru/). Each authorized user can 
publish their ads and any user can contact the seller via the feedback form. Each ad is pre-moderated by the 
administrators of the service. Administrators can return an ad for revision, publish it, or archive it.
